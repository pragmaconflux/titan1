# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is best-effort and maintained on a rolling basis. If you find a security issue, please report it; fixes are typically released in the next patch/minor release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead:

- Open a **private advisory** via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainer via the email on the profile.

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Minimal reproduction steps
- The smallest possible sample that reproduces the issue

### Important: Evidence / PII

Do not include real incident logs, browser history databases, or other sensitive evidence in security reports. If you must share artifacts, redact PII and provide synthetic/minimized samples.
