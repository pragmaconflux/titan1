# Code of Conduct

This project aims to be a respectful, professional place to collaborate on DFIR/malware-analysis tooling.

## Our Standards

We expect participants to:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent and communicate clearly
- Focus on technical merit
- Respect privacy and safety (see “Sensitive Data”)

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hate, threats, unwanted sexual attention, doxxing, and sustained disruption.

## Sensitive Data (DFIR / Incident Evidence)

Do **not** post real incident evidence in public:

- logs, browser history DBs, screenshots, internal hostnames
- credentials, API keys, tokens
- personally identifiable information (PII)

Use synthetic/minimized examples whenever possible, and redact aggressively if you must share snippets.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately:

- Prefer GitHub’s private security/advisory channel for sensitive reports, or
- Contact the maintainer via the email on their GitHub profile

We’ll review reports in good faith and take appropriate action, which may include warnings or bans from project spaces.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions) and any other official collaboration channels.
